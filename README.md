# Cash

Writing this to figure out the api I want for this binary.

## Requirements

1. I want to view my financal performance for given month
 * MVP: Just CLI OUTPUT! then the next step up could serve that output into a html page.
 * MVP: income vs expenses (categorized) and thus saved
 * MVP categories: shared, solo
 * Default to the month-to-date of the current month.

2. An alternative sub command should pull transactions from the Up Bank API and append them to a file.
3. The web page should read the transactions from this file.


## TODO

* let's start by writing the transactions to a file.
